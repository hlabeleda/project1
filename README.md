my updates to project1

these are the index files and js files i worked on for project1.  the final project page was changed to columns instead of using tile like i have here.

i did contribute to the project but not as much as jason and rodrigo did.  the movie page was originally using tiles that hold the movie poster, movie title, overview, description of the movie, actor cards.  but because i didn't use bulma styling to move the cards and elements around (i used position: relative, margin-left, etc to move the cards inside the tile), when it was time to make page responsive, everything was off.  so they used my layout, id assignments, etc. but changed the page from using tile to columsn in order to make the page responsive.  so the  the credit goes to both of them for much of the project work.  they did an excellenet job putting together the final look and feel of the project and how it functions.
